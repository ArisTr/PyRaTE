# PyRaTE - non-LTE spectral lines simulations

PyRaTE is a multilevel radiative transfer code designed to post-process astrochemical simulations. The code uses the escape probablity method to calculate the population densities of the species under consideration. The code can handle most projection angles and all geometries.

The code is written in Python using an embarrassingly parallel strategy and it relies on the YT analysis toolkit and mpi4py.
